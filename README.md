<h1> Cashmaster: ATM-System-Using C</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This code implements a simple ATM system in the C programming language. The program prompts the user to enter their card number, and then displays a menu of options for the user to choose from. The available options are to check the account balance, withdraw funds from the account, or exit the program.

If the user chooses to withdraw funds, the program prompts the user to enter the amount they wish to withdraw. It then calculates the remaining balance after the withdrawal, displays the amount withdrawn and the remaining balance, and exits the program.

If the user chooses to check the account balance, the program simply displays the current balance and exits.

If the user chooses to exit the program, the program prints a message indicating that the user has successfully exited.

Note that this program is very simple and does not include any authentication or error handling. It assumes that the user enters valid input, and that there are no issues with accessing the account balance. This program is intended for educational purposes only, and should not be used for actual ATM systems.

<b>Note: The code for this project is saved as 'ATM_project.c' in this repository.<b>
